You can find them on various aggregator sites.\n\nSynopsis: Shiori was once a guitarist in a light music club in high school. But her first live performance was dashed when her brother ran away from home with a lot of debt, to become a musician in Tokyo. A decade later, Shiori is now a high school teacher, leading a boring, uneventful life and paying off the debtâ€¦ till she runs into the ghost of none other than a famous guitarist Jim-you-know-who. A story of a 27-year-old woman on her way to a music legend begins here.",
